# Todo

- Add test cases for (will need a make file + test dir)
    - hashmap
    - vector
    - heap
- Add demos/sample usage
- Generalize hashmap to support `void *` keys and require user to  specify
  a comparator function.
- Datastructures to add
    - stack
    - queue
    - balanced binary tree (probably AVL, but I've not done red black yet so maybe those)
